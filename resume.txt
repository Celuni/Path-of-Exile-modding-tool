- Search modify compare extract insert replace armour spells microtransactions in any way.
- Restrict and exclude filters to modify only some files.
- Many known mods (.aoc. .otc .epk .pet .atlas .env ...) or create yours.
- Batch process files. Create automods (.txt files with basic filters and commands) to apply all your mods in sequence (see two examples below).
- Resize textures. Textures (.DDS) are decompressed when extracted, ready to feed a DDS optimizer (DDSOpt, ...) to improve both performance and quality.
- Automatic backup. Defragment. Works on all PoE versions, does not depend on Grinding Gear Games updates : file search and file mods rely on Python.re regular expressions
- Any OS. Install Python 3 and as admin run pip3 install brotli. Click or run __init__.py to launch app.
